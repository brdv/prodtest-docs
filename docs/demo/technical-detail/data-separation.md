We have talked about ways to separate data when using a dark launch [over here](/tip-basics/dark-launch/data-separation). On this page we will look at how data separation is implemented in the [prodtest-demo](https://github.com/brdv/prodtest-demo) project's dark launch.

## Situation

As a refresher, the architecture of the demo project:

![demo project architecture](./img/components-overview.png)

In the demo, we have two main components that store or save data: the message queue and the database. The kitchen service publishes new orders onto the message queue. The kitchen service is subscribe to the queue that those messages are published to and - after preparing - will save handled orders into a database.

This leaves us with two possible ways of data polltion: the database and the message queue.

## Database

The kitchen service uses a database to store information about handled orders. In this case, we do not want orders handled by Vnext to pollute orders handled by Vlatest.

### Options and choice

For databases, the main three options are: using a separate database, using a separate table and extending the data model. The option that was implemented in the demo project, is using a separate table. The main reason for this choice is that the database of the demo project is quite simple. It has only one table that is only used to write to. This means that adding a separate table will have minor impact on the database's performance. Thereby it is quite a simple solution, since we only have to specify and somehow create a separate table to be used by Vnext. Last, but not least, the data generated by Vnext will not be pollute the Vlatest data and the code will still have the desired cleanliness.

### Implementation

**Note:** The following implementation is from the `KitchenDbContext`, that is described [here](./kitchen-service.md).

The kitchen service has to use a separate table to store the data generated by Vnext. In dotnet, [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) is used to interact with the database. Entity Framework has a method on the modelBuilder called `.ToTable(string tableName)` in which you can specify the name of the table for a specific entity. We can use this in our advantage.

The base logic looks as follows (simplified):

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    var tableName = version == "latest" ? "HandledOrders" : "HandledOrdersShadow";

    modelBuilder.Entity<HandledOrder>().ToTable(tableName);

    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
}
```

This method overrides the OnModelCreating that is defined by the class DbContext which KitchenDbContext inherits. It is used to specify how to create the database models. On line 3 we check what the version is (this could be an environment variable, for example). On line 5 we explicitly specify what tableName to use for the HandledOrders objects and on line 7, we pass the modelbuilder to the base class (DbContext).

If the version is `latest`, we make the application use a table named `HandledOrders`. In all other cases, for example if the version variable is `Vnext`, we use the table named `HandledOrdersShadow`.

In this way, we make sure that two different versions of the application (i.e. Vlatest and Vnext), will not use the same database table.
