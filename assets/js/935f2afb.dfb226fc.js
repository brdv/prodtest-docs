A dark launch is a deployment or testing stategy for testing a newer version of a service or piece of software. The main goal of a dark launch is to mirror (a subset of) incoming production traffic to the new service but discarding the response. This allows you to monitor the funcitonality and performance of the service while under a real-world production load without taking the risk of exposing your users to it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
